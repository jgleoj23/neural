I created a neural network with kotlin and nd4j for recognizing hand written digits just for fun. It a port of the
neural network featured in https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com by Michael Nielson.

It recognizes hand written digits from the MNIST dataset. I also had a lot of fun parsing the MNIST dataset. 

The final version uses nd4j but I also tried using jblas and ejml to see which matrix multiplication library on the JVM was fastest.
